# Marce68.github.io

During my first working experience in Merloni Elettrodomestici SpA (renamed Indesit Company SpA and finally aquired by Whirlpool Corporation) I developed, with my colleague Marco Spuri and our teams, a system of connected appliances using power line communication based on LonWorks technology from Echelon Corporation.
After 20 years I discovered that Internet forgot all the job the we did, but I sill had a CDROM with the basic description (in Italian) of the concept.
The interface that you see in this HTML demo is a simple version of the Leon@rdo interface. If you consider that it was 1999 when we first showed it at Domothecnika in Koln, Germany, you can understand how much we were anticipating the IoT and the smartphone/tablet user interfaces.

My plan is to save in this repository as much as I can from my archive, and I hope that some of my colleagues could contribute.

I'm sad to see that Internet has a very short memory, but I'm happy to start using GitHub to preserve what I did. I hope that this can be useful to someone.
